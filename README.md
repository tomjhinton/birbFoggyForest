# birbFiggyForest

- For the second week in a row I've voluntarily written recreational react.
- Unsure there's a way to make react seem fun. 

- Made a shoddy tree in blender.
- Made a shoddy rock in blender.

- Really badly aranged a bunch of them in a couple of circles/ovals with some randomisation on the scale, rotation and positions.
- Unless it's one of the times when nothing overlapped and then I'm real smart and it's generative art.
- Used so many Math.random()'s I'll be needing a mastodon invite soon. 

- Little pond in the middle with a shader on.
- It's either polluted or possessed I guess.

- Little fog shader as a post-processing effect.
- Basically created a warp effect shader and used the red channel to alter the alpha of a white plane over the scene. 

- Did consider triggering a terrible midi version of A Forest by The Cure.
- [It really doesn't lend itself to midi](https://freemidi.org/download3-2532-a-forest-cure)
